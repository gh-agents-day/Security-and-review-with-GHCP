# Security Engineering with GitHub Copilot — Workshop

> **Audience**: Developers, security engineers, and DevSecOps practitioners  
> **Total Duration**: ~55 min mandatory + ~25 min optional (see two-track map below)  
> **Pre-requisites**: VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat extension, Python 3.9+, Git CLI, GitHub Copilot access, GitHub CLI (gh) v2.0+, Node.js 22+.

---

## What You Will Build

In this workshop you secure **SecureTrails**, a deliberately vulnerable Flask trail-booking application containing 28 real-world vulnerabilities across 6 OWASP Top 10 2021 categories. You will not write code — you will direct GitHub Copilot to detect, analyse, and fix every vulnerability using VS Code Chat, Copilot Agent inline edits, Copilot CLI, and custom security agents.

By the end of the mandatory track you will have: detected hardcoded secrets with secret scanning, reviewed code with VS Code Code Review, fixed SQL injection with parameterised queries, locked down broken authentication and IDOR, remediated XSS and CORS misconfigurations, and produced reusable OWASP security agents committable to any repository.



| Vulnerability | OWASP Category | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **SQL Injection (login, search, view_trail)** | A03 — Injection | Critical |
| **Broken Authentication / IDOR** | A01 — Broken Access Control | Critical |
| **XSS — Jinja2 unescaped output + DOM-based** | A03 — Injection | High |
| **Hardcoded Secrets (SECRET_KEY, JWT_SECRET)** | A02 — Cryptographic Failures | Critical |
| **Weak Password Hashing (MD5)** | A02 — Cryptographic Failures | High |
| **Debug Mode + Sensitive `/debug` Endpoint** | A05 — Security Misconfiguration | High |

## Key GitHub Copilot Features Covered

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Secret Scanning (`plugins`)** | Scans code for exposed credentials using GitHub's detection patterns |
| **VS Code Code Review** | Reviews a selection or uncommitted changes with inline suggestions and one-click fixes |
| **Copilot Instructions** | Customises Copilot's behaviour in reviews and chat with repository-specific instructions |
| **Copilot Agent (Inline `Ctrl+I`)** | Applies fix patterns across entire files in one agentic step |
| **Copilot CLI `/review`** | Agentic CLI code review of git changes — no browser required |
| **Custom Agents (`.agent.md`)** | Reusable, committable security expertise packages per vulnerability class |
| **Copilot Autofix** | One-click patches generated directly on GitHub CodeQL alert pages |
| **GitHub Issues MCP** | Creates tracked, labelled security issues from findings without leaving the terminal |

## Getting Started

1. Select **use this template** to create a new repository
1. Clone the repository and open it in VS Code
1. Ensure **GitHub Copilot** and **GitHub Copilot Chat** extensions are installed and signed in
1. Open the Copilot Chat panel (`Ctrl+Alt+I`)
1. Start with [Exercise 01](workshop/exercise-01-setup.md)

> **Instructor Note**: Exercises are designed so attendees never need to copy code — they copy **prompts** and let Copilot generate the output.
